## Project Summary

Rockbusters film inventory, Customers, Payments, Stores, Staff, Films, Actors, rental history, and addresses. The analysis identifies which movies contributed most or least to revenue, average rental durations, customer geographical distribution, lifetime value hotspots, and sales variation across regions. pgAdmin4 and PostgreSQL were used when working with data, and Tableau Public was used to create visualizations.
